Assumptions:
1. The Game will remember the last saved file per game, not per player.
2. After Load all players are treated like they already place their first sequence.
3. The Project is tested with NetBeans, and JDK 8.
4. Joker is counted as the tile it replace in the first added sequence.
5. If player chooses to resign from the game, his tiles are staying with him and don't return back to the game.
6. If player creates a wrong sequence on his first step, he will be punished by taking 3 tiles from the deck.
7. If player performed any change on the board, he can't take tile from deck on the same step.
